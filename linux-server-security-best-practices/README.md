If you want to test your web application or service, you need a Linux server. Thanks to the advancement of cloud computing, deploying preconfigured Linux server has become child's play.

Moreover, many cloud server providers also offer free credits to try their platform. You can take advantage of these offers to deploy Linux servers and test your web application or service.

This not only helps in reducing costs, you also get the opportunity to figure out whether a certain platform suits your needs and skills or not.
